1. Evaluate Simplicity: Assess each code snippet for unnecessary complexity and cognitive burden. Determine whether the implementation achieves its purpose with the minimum required elements. Look for over-engineering, redundant abstractions, excessive branching, and features that complicate the solution beyond what is needed. A simpler solution uses fewer moving parts while still being complete and correct. This task measures how easily a reader can hold the entire logic in their mind without being distracted by unnecessary complications.

2. Evaluate Clarity: Assess each code snippet for how unmistakably it communicates intent and meaning. Examine whether variable names illuminate purpose, function names describe actions accurately, and the overall structure reveals the logical flow. Determine if the code's meaning is obvious without requiring extensive explanation or comments. A clearer solution makes assumptions explicit and demonstrates the "why" behind design decisions. This task measures how quickly a future maintainer can understand what the code does and why it was written that way.
